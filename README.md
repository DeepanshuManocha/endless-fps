# FPS Endless Shooter (Template Core)

Minimal R3F + Cannon-es starter with:

- Finite ground plane with physics
- Player as a **cylinder** (no jump), WASD movement, pointer-lock look
- Perimeter walls so you canâ€™t fall off
- Config-first tuning (player speed, ground size, wall size, etc.)

## Stack

- React + Vite + TypeScript
- three + @react-three/fiber + @react-three/drei
- cannon-es + @react-three/cannon

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```
